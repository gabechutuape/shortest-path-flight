# Development Log

### Progress 12/4 (gfc2)
Today, I added the required data files for the project to work, those being the 
routes, airlines, and airports from OpenFlights. I also added the logic for parsing lines of data from
CSV files into our master logic file, which is called "assembler.cpp". Lastly, I added a TODO.md for 
project cohesion and I copied our project goals to our README.md so that our GitHub wouldn't look barren when you clicked on it.
