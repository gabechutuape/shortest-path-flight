# Flight Path Project TODO

### File Operations
- [ ] Reading CSV files
  - Identifying the data we use in our CSV will be in a .h file of some kind
- [ ] Handling CSV files
  - This follows the same idea as the previous tickbox

### Logic Operations
- [ ] Breadth First Search Implementation
  - [ ] Figure out how to apply breadth first search using data from our CSVs to project specification
  - How can we apply the ideas of breadth first search to finding a route between airports?
  - The idea to remember is that we're also trying to find the "shortest path" between them.
  - This applies to all the algorithms.

- [ ] Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation
  - [ ] Figure out how to apply Dijkstra's Algorithm using data from our CSVs to project specification

- [ ] Landmark Path Algorithm Implementation
  - [ ] Figure out how to apply Landmark Path Algorithm using data from our CSVs to project specification

- [ ] Airlines and Airports
  - How do we know what airlines service what airports?
  - Using whatever airlines service whatever airports, how can we use that information to get a user from airport A to airport B?
  - How do we tie together the information from OpenFlights between airlines and airports?

### Project Output
- [ ] Output user requested information in console
  - [ ] Obtain user requested information in usable format
